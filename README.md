# Graph Vertex Coloring Game

This game is based on a field of math called competitive graph theory.  This involves playing a game on a graph.  In math, a graph is simply a bunch of vertices (dots) connected by edges (lines).  The game is played by two players, usually called Alice and Bob.  Each player takes turns coloring a vertex.  The only rule is that two connected vertices cannot have the same color.

Alice plays first.  Alice and Bob have different goals.  Alice wants to color every vertex in the graph, Bob wants to stop her doing that.  No one can skip a turn. The mathematical interest in this problem involves the number of colors.  A common question to ask is what is the minimum number of colors needed for Alice to always have a winning strategy for a particular graph.  Answering this question usually involves playing a lot of games on the graph.  Hence, this program allows a researcher to play the game many times over.
